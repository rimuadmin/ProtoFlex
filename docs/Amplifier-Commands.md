## SET

Configure amplifier parameters.

```
C[D]<seq_number>|amplifier set <handle> operate=<0|1>
```

**Parameters:**
- `<handle>` = amplifier handle/identifier
- `operate` = amplifier operating mode (0=standby, 1=operate)

**Example:**
```
C400|amplifier set 0x12345678 operate=1
```

**Response:**
```
R400|0||                                         (success - amplifier set to operate)
R400|50000015||Amplifier not found               (error - invalid handle)
```

## Notes

- Amplifiers are identified by unique handles assigned by the radio
- The `operate` parameter controls whether the amplifier is in standby (0) or ready to transmit (1)
- Amplifier status updates are received through the subscription system (`sub amplifier all`)
